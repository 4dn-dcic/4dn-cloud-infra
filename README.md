## Testing the Deployment

Once the ECS Service has come online, the portal should be accessible from the URL output from the ECS Stack. At this
point we are ready to start testing the portal functionality by loading a demo case. Some important caveats of the
current test setup:

* Further customization is needed to run this on new environments. Full customization out of the box is still TODO.
* Bioinformatics analysis is completely mocked out (an output VCF is uploaded immediately).
* It may take a few hours for this process to run, especially if it is the first time.


Instructions for testing:  (TODO: May need some updating)

    # First load required knowledge base data
    make load-knowledge-base

    # Then perform metadata bundle submission
    make submission

    # Then, after following the "make submission" output instructions
    # queue output VCF ingestion
    make ingestion

## Deploying Foursight for Development

`foursight_development` contains scripts for running foursight checks and actions for
development purposes as well as a separate app configuration (`development_app.py`) than
the one used for deployment.

For more information, see `docs/running_foursight_from_ec2.rst`.
