Populating the Global Env Bucket
================================

The global env bucket (mediated by the environment variable GLOBAL_ENV_BUCKET) contains a set of files,
each of which is the information needed for a given environment.

For example, to have a cgap-mastertest environment, you want to create the file cgap-mastertest in this bucket.
Details on how to do that are in the file ``docs/deploy_new_account.rst`` in the ``4dn-cloud-infra`` repo.
